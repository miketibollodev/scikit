    "# Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "**Overfitting**: occurs when a model is too complex for the data. It too closely models the training data, meaning it will be inaccurate when using *new data*. It happens when:\n",
    "- There is not enough data to train on\n",
    "- There is too much noise in the relationship between *x* and *y*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Underfitting**: occurs when a model is too simple for the data. It does not approximate the generative process well. It happens when:\n",
    "- There is plenty of data\n",
    "- There is low noise and the model is too constrained to capture this noise\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a clear tradeoff between overfitting and underfitting."

    "## Training Error and Testing Error\n",
    "In the prior module's notebooks, we used `predict` on our model and `cross_validate` to test the accuracy. They are testing two fundamental different types of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Error**: the error that occurs on the training set. This is the error we get from using `cross_validate`.\n",

    "**Testing Error**: the error that occurs on predicting new data from the testing set. This is the error we get from using `predict` or `score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This underscores the importance of cross-validation. We are able to get an estimate of the variability of the model's generalization performance through various different splits of the data."
