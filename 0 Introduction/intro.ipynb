    "# Introduction\n",
    "**Machine Learning:** machine learning deals with building predictive models. One of the goals of machine learning is *generalizing*, which is concluding on new instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of this is that there are many sources of variability. For example, if we are trying to predict if a person is wealthy, their attributes are widely variate like education background, race, marital status, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical workflow in machine learning is to use a training dataset to build a model, and apply it to new data to make predictions (with a testing dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning Vocabulary:**\n",
    "- We use a data matrix, which is a tabular form of data where rows are different observations (*samples*) and columns are different descriptors (*features*).\n",
    "- In supervised machine learning, we say that data is *annotated* or *labeled*. The purpose is to predict the target/label, or in other words, given a data matrix *X* with *n* observations we predict *y*.\n",
    "- In unsupervised learning, we are given a data matrix *X* with *n* observations. The goal is to extract some structure from *X* as there are no labels."

    "In supervised learning we want to predict *y*, which can be discrete or continuous.\n",
    "- **Classification:** *y* is discrete, made of different classes (i.e., predicting animal species).\n",
    "- **Regression:** *y* is continuous, which is a numerical quantity (i.e., predicting income)."
